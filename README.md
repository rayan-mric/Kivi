Here is a revised **README.md for KIVI**, fully written in **third-person perspective** and avoiding the word *“you”*.

# **KIVI 🎲🟦**

**KIVI** is a strategic board-and-dice game in which players roll **six dice** and place stones on a scoring grid based on the resulting dice combinations. The game blends probability, tactical placement, and pattern-building to determine the ultimate winner.

---

## 🎮 **Game Overview**

Each turn consists of:

1. A player rolling **all six dice simultaneously**
2. Identifying any valid combinations created by the roll
3. Selecting a grid square that corresponds to one of the qualifying combinations
4. Placing a stone on that square

If no valid square exists for the rolled combinations, the stone for that round is returned to the player’s supply and is not placed on the board.

The game is played for **ten rounds**, matching the ten stones available to each player.
After ten rounds, all stones on the board are scored.

# 🎲 **Dice Combinations**

The following combinations determine which grid squares are available for placement:

---

## **1-Point Combinations**

* **Two pairs**
  Two dice share one value, and another two dice share a different value.

* **Three of a kind**
  Three dice share the same value.

* **Little straight**
  Any **four** dice form a sequence of consecutive numbers.

* **Full house**
  Three dice show one value and two dice show another.

---

## **2-Point Combinations**

* **Four of a kind**
  Four dice show the same value.

* **Large straight**
  Any **five** dice form a consecutive sequence.

* **All even**
  All six dice show even numbers.

* **All odd**
  All six dice show odd numbers.

* **12 or fewer**
  The sum of all dice is **12 or less**.

* **30 or more**
  The sum of all dice is **30 or more**.

---

## **3-Point Combinations**

* **Three pairs**
  The six dice form three separate pairs.

* **Two times three of a kind**
  Three dice show one value, and the remaining three dice show another.

* **Four of a kind and a pair**
  Four dice share one value, and the remaining two dice share another.

---

## **Special Combinations**

The following combinations allow a stone to be placed **on any free square**:

* **Five of a kind**
* **Straight from 1 to 6**

Additionally:

* **Six of a kind**
  Allows placement on **any square**, even if the square is already occupied.
  The stone occupying that square is then relocated to **any other free space** chosen by the player.

---

# 📍 **Placement Rules**

* Placement is restricted to squares matching the combinations formed by the roll.
* Multiple matching combinations allow the player to choose among the corresponding squares.
* Inability to place a stone results in the stone being removed from play for that round.

---

# 🧮 **Scoring**

After ten rounds, scoring proceeds as follows:

1. Only stones remaining on the board are counted.
2. Stones form **contiguous rows**, either horizontally or vertically (not diagonally).
3. Each row scores:

> **(Total points shown in the row’s squares) × (Length of the row)**

* A single stone counts as a row of length 1.
* Longer rows result in exponentially higher scores.

The player with the **highest total score** after all rows are evaluated is declared the winner.
